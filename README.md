# JAPE Mode

Provides Emacs font-lock and basic syntax tables for the [JAPE (Java Annotation Pattern Engine) files](https://gate.ac.uk/sale/tao/splitch8.html#x12-2150008) for the [GATE (General Architecture for Text Engineering)](https://gate.ac.uk/).

As of Fri, 29 Aug 2014 this does not yet provide proper indentation or support for embedded Java code. Hopefully these will be provided in future updates. Any contributions are welcome.

## Installation

Will hopefully be available on MELPA in the future, but currently only available through manual install by placing in a location where emacs knows to read emacs-lisp files (such as in `.emacs.d/`) and require with `(require 'jape-mode)`.
